Implement a method within `Point` to compute the aggregate sum and difference of all the points in our list. Keep in mind that subtraction does not commute; the reference solution assumes the order of points given in `points_list`. For example, if we have a list of points, $[(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4)]$, the sum would be $(6, 7)$ and the difference would be $(-4, -3)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we will use these points to solve a real world problem!  Points are just a two dimensional object, so we can use them to represent numerical features of a data set.  One thing we might want to do with a two dimensional data set is to separate the points into two classes.  Here we will implement an iterative algorithm to do this which will be a specific case of the very general $k$-means clustering algorithm.  The algorithm will require us to keep track of two clusters, each of which have a list of points and a center (which is another point, not necessarily one of the points we are clustering).  After making an initial guess at the center of the two clusters ($C_1$, $C_2$, the steps proceed as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign each point to $C_1$ or $C_2$ based on whether the point is closer to the center of $C_1$ or $C_2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "See [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Standard_algorithm) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm will terminate in general when the assignments no longer change.  For this question, we would like you to initialize one cluster at `(1, 0)` and the other at `(-1, 0)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The returned values should be the two centers of the clusters ordered by greatest `x` value.  Please return these a list of numeric tuples $[(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this we will create a class called cluster which has two methods besides `__init__` which you will need to write.  The first method `update` will update the center of the Cluster given the points contained in the attribute `points`.  Remember, you after updating the center of the cluster, you will want to reassign the points and thus remove previous assignments.  The other method `add_point` will add a point to the `points` attribute."
